# Source Code

This folder will contain the core, reusable code for my PhD:
- `data_pipeline.py` – fetches and processes satellite, climate, census data.
- `gan_model.py` – the GAN architecture.
- `physics_penalties.py` – physics rules as differentiable functions.
- `homer_exporter.py` – exports profiles for HOMER.
- `toolkit/` – the final user‑friendly tool.
