# PhD Research: AI for Solar Mini‑Grid Design in Rural Nigeria

## 👋 About Me
I'm **Hadiza Mijinyawa**, a PTDF scholar and PhD researcher at the University of Portsmouth (starting April 2026).

## 🔬 Research Overview
This repository documents my PhD journey: building a **physics‑informed generative AI framework** that creates hyper‑local energy demand profiles for rural Nigerian villages. The goal is to design solar mini‑grids that actually work for the communities they serve.

**The core innovation:** Translating publicly available satellite, climate, and census data into hyper‑local energy profiles without requiring any historical consumption data, using a physics‑informed generative model validated against Nigerian economic reality.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `module-0/` – Foundational Python scripts (learning basics).
- `src/` – Core, reusable source code for the PhD.
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for exploration and experiments.
- `research-log.md` – Daily diary of progress, questions, and ideas.

## 🚀 Current Status
✅ Module 0 completed (Python basics, GitHub setup).  
⏳ Next: Module 1 – NASA climate data pipeline.
